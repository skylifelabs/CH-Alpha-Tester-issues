# Alpha Testers Issue Tracking

## Introduction
Welcome to our unofficial issue tracking repository for the ongoing testing of our company's iOS and Android application. This platform is intended to serve as a central hub for Alpha testers to report, track, and discuss issues encountered during testing. The initiative aims to improve the efficiency of our testing process by reducing redundancy and enhancing communication among testers.

## How to Report Issues
To report a new issue, please follow these steps:
1. **Check Existing Issues**: Before creating a new issue, please check if the issue has already been reported. This helps avoid duplicates.
2. **Create a New Issue**: If the issue is new, create a new issue in the repository.
3. **Issue Template**: Follow the issue template provided. This includes a title, a brief description, steps to reproduce the issue, expected versus actual results, and any relevant screenshots or logs.
4. **Labels**: Use labels to categorize the issue based on its type (e.g., bug, enhancement), priority (e.g., high, medium, low), and platform (iOS, Android).

## Communication and Discussion
- **Comments**: Use the comment section under each issue for discussions, updates, or to provide additional information.
- **Respect and Constructiveness**: Always communicate with respect and focus on constructive feedback.

## Issue Resolution
- Once an issue is resolved, it should be marked as closed.
- Provide a brief comment on how the issue was resolved or why it was closed.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Respect Privacy and Confidentiality**: Do not include any sensitive information about the app or the company.
- **Stay On Topic**: Keep discussions focused on the issues related to the app testing.
